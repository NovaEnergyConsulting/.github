# Nova Energy Consulting

We help asset owners achieve their energy transition objectives

## Digital Transformation
Transitioning to world where new forms of energy are the norm require new ways of doing things. 

The value of these new processes is exponentially multiplied by the use of digital technologies.

Unlocking this value requires more than building digital replicas of analog processes. A digital data-capture form does not provide much more value than its paper counterpart if it is not part of a systemic thinking design.

Our expertise ranges from the collection of raw data to the creation of models and the visualisation of outcomes.

Our team helps our clients in designing and implementing transformative value-adding digital strategies and roadmaps. 

## Asset Management
Connecting strategic objectives to asset management practices is fundamental to an asset intensive organisation. This is particularly true during a transition.

A well-defined asset management plan is essential to achieve these objectives in the safest, most reliable and efficient way.

Using well-proven best practices and methodologies in asset management, our team helps you identify asset objectives, develop appropriate strategies, monitor their condition and setup adequate key performance indicators to measure their performance.

## Risk Management
A complex environment is often rich in competing objectives and uncertain timings.

A robust risk-based management framework is required to make sound, defendable and traceable decisions in this type of environment.

With decades of combined experience in the practical development and application of these risk-based management frameworks, our team helps organisations of all sizes in increasing their risk maturity no matter what step of the journey they are in.

With these frameworks in place, our clients gain unparalleled clarity in the priorities that mitigate risks and realise opportunities.
